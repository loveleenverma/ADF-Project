# Azure Data Factory (ADF) Data Ingestion and Transformation Project

## Introduction

This comprehensive Azure Data Factory (ADF) project demonstrates a powerful data integration and transformation solution, enabling seamless ingestion and processing of data from various sources into Azure SQL Database. Designed for developers, data engineers, and data enthusiasts, this project serves as a step-by-step guide and a reliable reference for building end-to-end data pipelines within the Azure ecosystem.

## Project Overview

The project encompasses the following key components and functionalities:

1. **Data Ingestion from Azure Data Lake:** Utilizing ADF pipelines, the project automates data ingestion from Azure Data Lake whenever a new file is added, ensuring real-time data availability.

2. **Data Ingestion from HTTP Website:** The ADF pipeline efficiently ingests data from an HTTP website, enabling seamless integration with other data sources.

3. **Data Transformation with Data Flows:** A variety of ADF data flows are used for data transformation tasks, providing flexibility in cleaning, enriching, and aggregating data.

4. **Advanced Transformation with Databricks and HDInsight:** To perform complex and high-level data transformations, the project integrates Databricks and HDInsight notebooks, seamlessly executing them within ADF pipelines.

5. **Data Storage in Azure SQL Database:** Processed and transformed data is automatically stored in Azure SQL Database, providing a scalable and managed environment for data warehousing.

6. **Pipeline Orchestration:** The project showcases both pipeline-level and trigger-level orchestration, ensuring automated and timely execution of data integration processes.
